# 65pkmlz

This is MOS 6502 assembly implementation of a decompressor for an lz variant used in Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal. It is converted from [/home/decompress.asm in Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/home/decompress.asm). Written for 64tass assembler with a compatibility for all 6502 variants.

For a compressor, you can use lzcomp provided in the source code of Pokémon Prism or gfx.py in [poketools](https://github.com/pret/pokemon-reverse-engineering-tools)
